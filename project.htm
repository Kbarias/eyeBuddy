	<p>Check out the latest application for getting you around campus without needing to depend on anybody! Have issues navigating through campus and hate asking for directions? No problem. eyeBuddy lets you know where specific locations are in a building, such as the bathroom, stairs, elevators, and more! Don't be afraid of getting lost anymore.</p>

	<p>Expanding on the technology of Google Maps, eyeBuddy will navigate you where Google left off, which is at the entrance of the building. eyeBuddy is able to navigate users through audio cues, such as "turn left in three steps." The app uses the floor maps of campus buildings to gather information for its users. The user will be able to activate the app through Siri and tap anywhere on the screen to start it up.</p>

	<p>While the app was created for people that are visually impaired, those who might be socially anxious and are uncomfortable with asking for directions can benefit from the app as well. Other applications that are targetted to those visually impaired, don't offer indoor navigation and require volunteer help. eyeBuddy allows you to travel at your own time and with independence.</p>

	<p>It is our goal to develop this app into something bigger that could be used in all CUNY campuses and then later even into New York public transit. </p>
